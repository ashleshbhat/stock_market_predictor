Welcome to the stock_market_predictor wiki about our project called `Profit Maker`!

# Introduction

This repo is the final project for our BIGDATA subject in the MASTEAM degree at UPC-Castelldefels. Basically the project is to use Bid Data in order to predict the stock price for stocks listed in the NASDAQ.

For the beginning we focused only on the stock Apple but the same procedure should be reproducible for other stocks in a similar way. 

We structured our wiki into the following parts:
* [Utilization of the Alphavantage API for stock data collection](https://github.com/ashleshbhat/stock_market_predictor/wiki/Utilization-of-the-Alphavantage-API-for-stock-data-collection)
* [Gathering news information through the NYT data feed](https://github.com/ashleshbhat/stock_market_predictor/wiki/Gathering-news-information-through-the-NYT-data-feed)
* [Processing the news information with sentiment analysis](https://github.com/ashleshbhat/stock_market_predictor/wiki/Processing-the-news-information-with-sentiment-analysis)
* [Running classification and regression algorithms on the collected data](https://github.com/ashleshbhat/stock_market_predictor/wiki/Running-classification-and-regression-algorithms-on-the-collected-data)
* [Some results and comments](https://github.com/ashleshbhat/stock_market_predictor/wiki/Some-results-and-comments)
* [Conclusions](https://github.com/ashleshbhat/stock_market_predictor/wiki/Conclusions)
